Obi-Wan Kenobi: Hello there.
General Grievous: General Kenobi. You are a bold one.  Kill him!
General Grievous:  Back away! I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
Obi-Wan Kenobi: Your move.
General Grievous: You fool. I've been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
General Grievous: Attack, Kenobi!
